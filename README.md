## Project Description

### Origin

This project idea came from two public school elementary teachers looking for new ways to help students in remote classrooms learn new vocabulary words.

One of these teachers, Andrew, brought the idea to his classmates in UCLA's Full-Stack Development course, and they brought it to life!

### Game Explanation

| Two players start with a blank board        | Each of the 9 squares has a picture on it, with the words corresponding to the pictures off to the side.          | ![480x270](https://www.fillmurray.com/g/640/360)                                                                                                 |
| Players take turns marking their "X" or "O" | To claim a space, players match a vocab word's picture from the board with the written word on the side.          | _Example_: A player clicks on a "cow" picture on the board, and the word "vaca" in the word list on the side. This earns an "X" for that player. |
| Players alternate, taking turns             | Players alternate matching pictures and words. However, if a player's attempt is incorrect, they lose their turn. |
